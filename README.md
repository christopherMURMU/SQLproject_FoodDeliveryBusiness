# SQLproject_FoodDeliveryBusiness
 I have created this SQL portfolio project which analyzes a food delivery business using structured query language (SQL) to extract key insights from its dataset.
 
This SQL project also showcases my expertise in SQL through 19 business insight queries for the food delivery business.

The project is structured into three difficulty levels—Easy, Intermediate, and Advanced—based on the complexity of SQL concepts used.

Easy Level Questions: Focus on fundamental SQL queries such as filtering, sorting, and basic aggregations.

Intermediate Level Questions: Involve more complex operations like Joins, Case Statements, Time based queries and Grouping techniques.

Advanced Level Questions: Utilize advanced SQL concepts such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Subqueries, Window Functions, and Analytical Queries.
